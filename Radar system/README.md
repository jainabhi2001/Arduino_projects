This is a arduino based radar system which detects the object that comes it its path and shows it in red lines.
For this project you need 2 sofwares:
i) Arduino Ide
ii) Processing3 

I have attached the codes for the softwares.
Remember : You need to first upload the arduino code and then run the processing3 code on it.
